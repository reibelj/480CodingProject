# Optimized Travel Pathfinding (480 Code project)

#### HONOR CODE: This work is mine unless otherwise cited.
#### Previous work includes contributions from Spencer Huang, Christopher Cook, and Dipto Mukherjee.


## Usage Instructions:
Note: All of the source code is located within the `SourceCode/` folder.

1. Please note that all of the python code has been written in Python 2.7 and has been updated to work with Python 3
4. Make sure you are within the `SourceCode/` directory when trying to run the program.
5. Type `python interface.py` to start the program and follow the on-screen instructions.

#### Project overview

Based on the course project from the Algorithm Analysis course, this project is an applied and optimized pathfinding algorithm. Utilizing Djikstra's algorithm in order to find the paths and developing a graph based on travel destinations, this project is able to determine the optimized  path between two nodes or travel destinations. Since this project was developed during my time at Allegheny College, locations were based on major cities surrounding Meadville PA. Further work will be implemented in order to cover a larger region and try to fully optimize travel paths.
